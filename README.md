# Dummy Co. Recipe Retriever App ü•° üçï

## TL;DR

> This will fire up everything

```
pnpm run magic
```

## Description

This application consists of two apps ‚Äî an expressJs backend and a React frontend ‚Äî plus a shared types folder.

The backend fetches data from [dummyjson.com](https://dummyjson.com ), the section I chose: recipes ‚Äî because I genuinely love cooking üç≥.

The frontend then displays the fetched recipes with a few properties. It also includes two buttons:

* One logs the recipe data to the backend console as a nicely formatted, stringified JSON.

* The other logs a cleaner version in a table format using console.table, where I omitted some properties for readability.(Honestly, I really enjoyed having a good excuse to finally use `console.table`!)

## Used Technologies

- ExpressJs (MVCish pattern)
- React (Vite)
- Tailwind

## Assignment

- [x] Use https://dummyjson.com for dummy JSON data. Use a section of your choosing under ‚ÄúTop Resources‚Äù to fetch and display.
- [x] Do the fetching in the Node.JS backend and send the information to the React font end.
- [x] Only a minimum of two fields from the data need to be displayed in the front end. Keep this part very simple. How the information is formatted/displayed is up to you.
- [x] Demonstrate a basic understanding of the React hooks useState and useEffect, by utilizing them in some capacity.
- [x] Include a button in the front end which will trigger the back end to console output a formatted version of the data it has fetched.
- [x] This should be a plain-text formatted version, for example, formatting the JSON data as a plain text table.
- [x] You may use any framework or method of your choice to connect the backend to the frontend.
- [ ] Feel free to ask as many questions for clarification as you‚Äôd like. Be advised, though, that if I haven‚Äôt specified something it is most-likely up to you.
