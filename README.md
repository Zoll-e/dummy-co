* [ ] Use https://dummyjson.com for dummy JSON data. Use a section of your choosing under “Top Resources” to fetch and display.
* [ ] Do the fetching in the Node.JS backend and send the information to the React font end.
* [ ] Only a minimum of two fields from the data need to be displayed in the front end. Keep this part very simple. How the information is formatted/displayed is up to you.
* [ ] Demonstrate a basic understanding of the React hooks useState and useEffect, by utilizing them in some capacity.
* [ ] Include a button in the front end which will trigger the back end to console output a formatted version of the data it has fetched.
* [ ] This should be a plain-text formatted version, for example, formatting the JSON data as a plain text table.
* [ ] You may use any framework or method of your choice to connect the backend to the frontend.
* [ ] Feel free to ask as many questions for clarification as you’d like. Be advised, though, that if I haven’t specified something it is most-likely up to you.
